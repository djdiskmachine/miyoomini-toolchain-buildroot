this repo downloads and configures buildroot to build libraries for the miyoomini toolchain

just cd into ~/buildroot and run make sdk (or make menuconfig to add additional libraries)

then you can copy out individual binaries, libraries, and headers from buildroot/output/host/arm-buildroot-linux-gnueabihf/sysroot/
or return to ~ and run ./package-toolchain.sh to generate ~/workspace/miyoomini-toolchain.tar.xz

eg.

	make shell
	cd ~/buildroot
	make sdk
	cd ~
	./package-toolchain.sh
	exit

find miyoomini-toolchain.tar.xz in the workspace folder
